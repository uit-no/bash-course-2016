Long story short: in 1986 an interviewer asked Donald Knuth to write a
program that takes a text and a number N in input, and lists the N
most used words sorted by their frequencies. Knuth produced a 10-pages
Pascal program, to which Douglas McIlroy replied with the following
shell script:

tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' |
tr A-Z a-z |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -rn |
sed ${1}q


tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
