Finding strings in files

man grep

grep the gettysburg.txt 
grep The gettysburg.txt 

case insensitive

grep -i the gettysburg.txt 

only print matching part -o

grep -o The gettysburg.txt

Does not work as expected

grep "--" gettysburg.txt 

Need to quote spaces

grep " the " gettysburg.txt 

Need to escape special characters

grep "\-\-" gettysburg.txt 

Counting matches -c

grep -c "\-\-" gettysburg.txt 
grep -c the gettysburg.txt 
grep -c The gettysburg.txt 
grep -c -i The gettysburg.txt 

Invert match -v

grep -v The gettysburg.txt

If you know regular expressions egrep 

egrep -o "(and|The)" gettysburg.txt

sed replacing words (but can do much more)

sed s/we/I/ gettysburg.txt 
sed s/we/I/ gettysburg.txt |grep we

use g to replace all occurences on a line

sed s/we/I/g gettysburg.txt |grep we
sed s/we/I/g gettysburg.txt 

you need to escape special characters

sed s/\\./\!/ gettysburg.txt
