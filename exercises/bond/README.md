The script `greeter.py` will greet you with the following message (imagine the
voice of Sean Connery): "Hi - My name is Bond, James Bond". Try it.

Your first task is to replace the text with your name but you are allowed to
type your last name only once in the script.

Your second task will be to generalize the script so that it can greet with any
name without modifying the script.

Discuss why this technique can be useful for you.

Your third task is to let the script order a Martini if the last name is "Bond"
and otherwise order your favourite drink.
