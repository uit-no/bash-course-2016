A brief chat about usefull stuff like:

* Symlinks

Symlinks are  - as you have seen - links that points at a certain file.

aka the alias alternative on windows-based systems (including mac interface).

$ cd symlinks
$ ls -l
$ mv symlinks symlinking.rst
$ ls -l
$ cd ..
$ ls -l

(What happened when we create a link and take away the original file.)

* The which command

If you want to find out about something:

$ which ls 

Where is the command placed, and typically which "version" of the command you are using.

* How to find out about disk usage - `du -h` 

$ du -h # man du

What do we see.
