navigation, or more precisely, how to navigate in the file tree structure 
of your computer.


We need a couple of tools for making this work in a proper way.

First we need to see files in a given folder, and navigate in between folders.

(How familiar are you with cd = change directory?)

cd / cd ../ cd - / cd ~

Please do as follows:
$ pwd
$ cd 
$ pwd
$ cd ~
$ pwd 
 - do you see any difference?

cd (what we got from pwd)

$ cd ..
$ cd -

We will investigate file permissions.


First; we need to talk about file permissions.

stat



command

.bash_history





examples:
 man cp
 cp --help

 man apropos
 apropos --help

 gcc --help
 man gcc

For the fun of it: Try type 

$ help

$ whatis help
$ apropos help

apropos/whatis?

$history

history -ctrl-r
Arrow up and arrow down.


history, up, down, reverse search
