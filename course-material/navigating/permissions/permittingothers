Standard permissions in linux is 664; meaning that 

user (=you) have permission R+W = 110 in binary numbers (=6 in decimal numbers)
group (=your standard group; typically you only) have permission R+W = 110 in binary numbers.
others (=rest of users outside of you and the given group) have permission R+X = 101 in binary numbers (4 in decimal).

So, lets make two folders:

$ cd permissions
$ mkdir permit1
$ cp permittingothers permit1
$ cp -R permit1 permit2

Then check permissions: Two ways of doing this - either ls -l or using the command stat.

$ ls -l

$ stat permit?

What do we see?

This has significance if we want to limit and/or allow access for others to our files and folders:

If you want to allow others to see the content of the folder, you need to give them R + X rights over the folder.

Do emphasize this:

$ chmod 444 permit1
$ chmod 344 permit2
$ ls permit?

What do you see? Weird? File permissions is exactly the same. Then set the file permissions rigth.

$ chmod 544 permit1
$ ls permit?

What do you see now?
